# Moos2

A hobby project for transforming playlists from [the radio station WFMU](https://wfmu.org/playlists/) into Spotify playlists on your account.

The intention is eventually to iterate on this specification in different languages.

```sh
$ ./moos2 [URL] [Name of playlist]
```

## Languages

- [X] Elixir
- [ ] Clojure
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Haskell

## To Do
